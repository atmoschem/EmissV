Description: Creates emissions for use in air quality models. Vehicular emissions 
  are estimated by a top-down approach, total emissions are calculated using the 
  statistical description of the fleet of vehicles, the emission is spatially 
  distributed according to satellite images or openstreetmap data 
  <https://www.openstreetmap.org> and then distributed temporarily 
  (Vara-Vela et al., 2016, <doi:10.5194/acp-16-777-2016>).
